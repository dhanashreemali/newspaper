            <p>
                Chandrayaan-3 was launched from Satish Dhawan Space Centre on 14 July 2023. The spacecraft entered lunar 
                orbit on 5 August, and the lander touched down near the Lunar south pole on 23 August at 18:03 IST, 
                making India the fourth country to successfully land on the Moon, and the first to do so near the 
                lunar south pole. On 3 September the lander hopped and repositioned itself 30-40 cm from its landing site.
                The Vikram lander and Pragyan rover were set to sleep on 2 September and 4 September respectively due to 
                depleting solar power with sunset at the landing site. The lander and rover are planned to start working 
                again at local sunrise on September 22.
